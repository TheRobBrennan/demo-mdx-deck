# Welcome
This project is intended to serve as a simple example for exploring [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) - a freely available tool that allows you to build presentations using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.htmlreac), and [React](https://reactjs.org) components.
